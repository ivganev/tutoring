# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is your tutoring style?

Whatever the topic at hand, my tutoring style involves sharing my enthusiasm while providing the supportive environment you need in order to learn at your own pace. Patience and flexibility are key to my collaborative style. My goal to have students grasp techniques and concepts while working through many concrete examples. Along the way, your grades will naturally go up, you'll perform well on exams, and eventually reach your learning goals.

## Who do you work with?

  <p>I'm happy to guide students of all ages! Most of the people I work with are college or masters students pursuing a degree in a STEM discipline, as well as talented high school students interested in math and coding. I also have a number of independent adult learners working on personal projects or looking to gain useful skills for their career.</p>

## Do you do in-person tutoring?

At the moment, I only do online tutoring via Zoom. 

## Can you do my homework for me? Maybe also the exam?

I can occasionally provide solutions to old homework problems (ones already submitted), but will not dictate solutions to current homework problems. Neither will I help you with take-home exams. 

## I'm eager to start tutoring. What's the next step?
