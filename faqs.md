# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is your tutoring style?

Whatever the topic at hand, my tutoring style involves sharing my enthusiasm while providing the supportive environment you need in order to learn at your own pace. Patience and flexibility are key to my collaborative style. My goal to have students grasp techniques and concepts while working through many concrete examples. Along the way, your grades will naturally go up, you'll perform well on exams, and eventually reach your learning goals.

## Who do you work with?

<p>I'm happy to guide students of all ages! Most of the people I work with are college or masters students pursuing a degree in a STEM discipline, as well as talented high school students interested in math and coding. I also frequently meet with independent adult learners working on personal projects or looking to gain useful skills for their career.</p>

## Do you do in-person tutoring?

At the moment, I only tutor online via Zoom. 

## Can you help me with _______________?

<p>Check out the <a href="./topics">topics</a> page, or send an email if what you're interested is not on the list. If pertinent, feel free to share the class syllabus or assignment you're working on.</p>

## Can you do my homework for me? Maybe also the exam?

I can occasionally provide solutions to old homework problems (ones already submitted), but will not dictate solutions to current homework problems. Similarly, I will help you prepare for exams, but won't solve exam questions directly. 

## Can I get a discount?

My rate is always negotiable. Let me know about your goals and financial situation. We'll decide on a mutually agreeable rate together.  

## I'm eager to start tutoring. What's the next step?

<p>Awesome! Email me with your availability and we'll find a time to meet. See the <a href="./pricing">pricing</a> page for information about my rate. I offer a free consultation session before diving into technical material.</p>
