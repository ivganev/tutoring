# Pricing

## Free Consultation

I offer a free 20-minute consultation to get to know each other and see if we're a good match. I'll ask you about your situation and what you're looking to gain from tutoring. 

## Tutoring rate

After the free consultation, my rate is $119 per hour. I'm open to negotiation depending on subject difficulty, the duration of our engagement, and different financial situations.

## Other services

I often provide students with customized study guides, exam prep worksheets, or typed solutions to old homework problems. The price for these services varies and is up to negotiation, but are generally at a lower rate than my tutoring rate.
