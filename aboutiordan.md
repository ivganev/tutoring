# Hi, I'm Iordan!

<img src="../assets/img/iordan1.jpg" alt="iordan" width="200"/>

I am a:

* PhD mathematician
* machine learning researcher
* data scientist
* educator

In case you're wondering, my name is pronounced like Jordan with an 'i'. But Jordan is also fine :). For more about me, check out my [personal site](https://ivganev.github.io/).


## Teaching and Tutoring Experience

  My first teaching experience was in high school, when my chemistry teacher let me teach the class for ten minutes to explain the reaction rate equations with calculus. Good times! 
  
  During my undergraduate studies at Miami University and Royal Holloway University, I worked as a teaching assistant for statistics classes, and tutored high school students preparing for AP Calculus. From there, I went on to earn a PhD in theoretical mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin. To fund my studies, I worked as a teaching assistant for all levels of calculus, in addition to differential equations, linear algebra, and college algebra. I also continued tutoring and mentoring on the side.
    
  Since graduating, I've been teaching mathematics and machine learning at several universities and institutes in the US and around the world (Austria, Israel, the Netherlands). In addition, I've co-organized several high school math camps in Ghana, Kenya, and Ethiopia.


## Tutoring style

Whatever the topic at hand, my tutoring style involves sharing my enthusiasm while providing the supportive environment you need in order to learn at your own pace. Patience and flexibility are key to my collaborative style. My goal to have students grasp techniques and concepts while working through many concrete examples. Along the way, your grades will naturally go up, you'll perform well on exams, and eventually reach your learning goals.

## Who do I work with?

  <p>I'm happy to guide students of all ages! Most of the people I work with are college or masters students pursuing a degree in a STEM discipline, as well as talented high school students interested in math and coding. I also have a number of independent adult learners working on personal projects or looking to gain useful skills for their career.</p>

## Rates

  <p>I offer a free 20-minute consultation to see if we're a good match. After that, my rate is $60 per hour, but am open to negotiation depending on subject difficulty, duration of our engagement, and different financial situations.</p>
