# Hi, I'm Iordan!

<img src="../assets/img/iordan1.jpg" alt="iordan" width="150"/>

I am a:

* PhD mathematician
* machine learning researcher
* data scientist
* educator

In case you're wondering, my name is pronounced like Jordan with an 'i'. But Jordan is also fine :).


## Teaching and Tutoring Experience

  My first teaching experience was in high school, when my chemistry teacher let me teach the class for ten minutes to explain the reaction rate equations with calculus. Good times! 
  
  During my undergraduate studies at Miami University and Royal Holloway University, I worked as a teaching assistant for statistics classes, and tutored high school students preparing for AP Calculus exams. From there, I went on to earn a PhD in theoretical mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin. To fund my studies, I worked as a teaching assistant for all levels of calculus, in addition to differential equations, linear algebra, and college algebra. I also continued tutoring and mentoring on the side.
    
  Since graduating, I've been teaching mathematics and machine learning at several universities and institutes in the US and around the world (Austria, Israel, the Netherlands). In addition, I've co-organized high school math camps in Ghana, Kenya, and Ethiopia.
