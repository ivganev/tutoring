## Feedback from students I've tutored:

> **Very knowledgable mathematician**. 
I worked with Iordan regularly over the course of a semester of graduate-level applied machine learning. He was always able to help explain the course content (which was very heavy in math), and he was also very helpful with the python programming assignments.
-- Max P.

> **Outstanding**. 
Iordan worked with me and refreshed some things as we worked on loops and nested loops, lists, dictionaries, classes, methods, and functions. Easy to talk to and listen to. He is extremely knowledgeable.
-- Roy S.

> **Very knowledgeable and easy to work with**.
Helped work through some questions and areas that were confusing in pandas. Very helpful - time well spent. Iordan has a caring and respectful demeanor which is conducive to a productive learning session.
-- Michael B.

> **Great tutor with great skills in Machine learning**. Iordan is also very responsible and would ask for materials in advance to prepare for the lesson.
-- Aaron Q.

## Feedback from students at UT Austin:

>**Iordan is literally the best TA I've seen.** During TA sessions, he'd always be lively and sweet and patient with even [with] off topic questions. If I didn't understand something, he'd explain it in such a way that gave me exactly the knowledge I was missing.

>**What a great TA to start my college experience with!** Iordan is very helpful in working through specific problems and finding meaning and broader patterns within each homework assignment. He knows how to explain both theoretically through proofs and mechanically for specific problems. He tailors the lesson to what we would like to go over and is always willing to talk over more extensive problems.

>**Iordan is an incredible TA.**. Incredibly interested in the student's success and he seems like in incredible guy. He definitely contributed a lot to my success in the class.

<!-- >**Iordan was excellent in answering my questions**. He clearly stated when and where his office hours were, and if I needed to contact him before discussion sections to ask about homework, he responded promptly and with hints that made me think about the problem. He made an effort to learn my name, and I appreciated that because it felt like he came to learn what kind of instruction I responded well to. I think he is one of the best TAs I have had, and am quite sad to have to get someone else to teach me calculus. -->

>**Iordan is the best teaching assistant I have had at UT.** Very knowledgeable, kind, and cares that you learn the material.


>**Iordan was committed to helping us learn the material** and always managed to simplify seemingly complicated mathematical concepts. 

<!-- He always encouraged all of us to take advantage of his office hours and would remind us that Discussion Sessions are for our own benefit so we should take advantage of them. Overall great TA. -->


>**He was rad**.

>**Iordan was an awesome teaching assistant**. He knew the material very well and clearly explained problems. I like how he doesn't just give the answer but rather lets the students think it out for themselves guiding them as they go along. He is also a very cool person.
