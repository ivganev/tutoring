## Feedback from students I've tutored

> **Very knowledgeable mathematician**. 
I worked with Iordan regularly over the course of a semester of graduate-level applied machine learning. He was always able to help explain the course content (which was very heavy in math), and he was also very helpful with the python programming assignments.
-- Max P.

> **Iordan is a really great tutor!** He worked with my daughter Sarah over the course of one full semester during her college Freshman year at UT Austin. Sarah wanted to get a head start in Sequence Series and Multivariable Calculus (M408D). She has greatly benefited from her tutoring sessions with Iordan, since he is very good at explaining problems. Sarah got to deeply understand her homework assignments and class contents, and therefore managed to improve her grade in the class. We highly recommend Iordan!

> **Outstanding**. 
Iordan worked with me and refreshed some things as we worked on loops and nested loops, lists, dictionaries, classes, methods, and functions. Easy to talk to and listen to. He is extremely knowledgeable.
-- Roy S.

> **Very knowledgeable and easy to work with**.
Helped work through some questions and areas that were confusing in pandas. Very helpful - time well spent. Iordan has a caring and respectful demeanor which is conducive to a productive learning session.
-- Michael B.

> **Great tutor with great skills in Machine learning**. Iordan is also very responsible and would ask for materials in advance to prepare for the lesson.
-- Aaron Q.

## Feedback from students at UT Austin

These are part of anonymous evaluations regarding my role as a teaching assistant for classes such as calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. 

>**What a great TA to start my college experience with!** Iordan is very helpful in working through specific problems and finding meaning and broader patterns within each homework assignment. He knows how to explain both theoretically through proofs and mechanically for specific problems. He tailors the lesson to what we would like to go over and is always willing to talk over more extensive problems.

>**Iordan is literally the best TA I've seen.** During TA sessions, he'd always be lively and sweet and patient with even with off topic questions. If I didn't understand something, he'd explain it in such a way that gave me exactly the knowledge I was missing.


>**Iordan is an incredible TA.** Incredibly interested in the student's success and an incredible guy. He definitely contributed a lot to my success in the class.

>**Iordan is the best teaching assistant I have had at UT.** Very knowledgeable, kind, and cares that you learn the material.

>**Iordan was an awesome teaching assistant**. He knew the material very well and clearly explained problems. I like how he doesn't just give the answer but rather lets the students think it out for themselves guiding them as they go along. He is also a very cool person.
